"""Price and Rating Disparity: 
The maximum price of a wine is $3,300, but the highest-rated wines (100 points) are not the most expensive, 
demonstrating that high prices do not always align with top scores.
Regional Influence on Wine Ratings: 
Countries like England, which is not traditionally known for expensive wines, have the highest average ratings (91.72 points).
Grape Variety Impact on Wine Reviews:
The list of top 5 best-rated wine origin designations includes a variety of grape types, suggesting that certain varieties are 
more likely to produce highly-rated wines, like the spanish grape called Tinta del Pa√≠s or Tempranillo from Ribera del Duero."""

Educate customers about the value of wines from emerging regions and specific grape varieties through in-store tastings,
